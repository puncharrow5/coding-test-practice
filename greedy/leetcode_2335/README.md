# Minimum Amount of Time to Fill Cups (LeetCode 2335)

You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up ```2``` cups with ***different*** types of water, or ```1``` cup of any type of water.

You are given a ***0-indexed*** integer array ```amount``` of length ```3``` where ```amount[0]```, ```amount[1]```, and ```amount[2]``` denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return the ***minimum*** number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.

### Example 1

Input: amount = [1,4,2]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:<br>
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.<br>
Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.<br>
Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.<br>
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.<br>
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.

### Example 2

Input: amount = [5,4,4]<br>
Output: 7<br>
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:<br>
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.<br>
Second 2: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.<br>
Second 3: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.<br>
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup, and a hot cup.<br>
Second 5: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.<br>
Second 6: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.<br>
Second 7: Fill up a hot cup.

### Example 3

Input: amount = [5,0,0]<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation: Every second, we fill up a cold cup.

### Constraints:

- ```amount.length == 3```
- ```0 <= amount[i] <= 100```
