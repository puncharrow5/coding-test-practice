# Longest Palindrome (LeetCode 409)

Given a string ```s``` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the ***longest palindrome*** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are ***case sensitive***, for example, ```"Aa"``` is not considered a palindrome.

### Example 1

Input: s = "abccccdd"<br>
Output: 7<br>
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

### Example 2

Input: s = "a"<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.

### Constraints:

- ```1 <= s.length <= 2000```
- ```s``` consists of lowercase ***and/or*** uppercase English letters only.
