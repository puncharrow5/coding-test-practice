# Largest Number After Digit Swaps by Parity (LeetCode 2231)

You are given a positive integer ```num```. You may swap any two digits of ```num``` that have the same ***parity*** (i.e. both odd digits or both even digits).

Return the ***largest*** possible value of ```num``` after ***any*** number of swaps.

### Example 1

Input: num = 1234<br>
Output: 3412<br>
Explanation: Swap the digit 3 with the digit 1, this results in the number 3214.<br>
Swap the digit 2 with the digit 4, this results in the number 3412.<br>
Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 3412 is the largest possible number.<br>
Also note that we may not swap the digit 4 with the digit 1 since they are of different parities.

### Example 2

Input: num = 65875<br>
Output: 87655<br>
Explanation: Swap the digit 8 with the digit 6, this results in the number 85675.<br>
Swap the first digit 5 with the digit 7, this results in the number 87655.<br>
Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 87655 is the largest possible number.

### Constraints:

- ``` 1 <= num <= 10^9```
